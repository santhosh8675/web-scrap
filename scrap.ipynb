After reading all the online horror stories I was scared out of my mind. However, I had a great experience on it. I took 80mg/day for 5 months and weigh 200 lbs (90 kgs) so it was about 1 mg/day/kg, which is a moderate to high dose I was told. My lips were pretty dry and cracked if I didn't put on chapstick all the time. I also had really dry skin if I didn't put lotion on my shoulders, arms, back, and face after showering. Everything else was 100% fine though. No nosebleeds, no depression, no hair loss, no unbearable side effects. These horror stories are overblown and rare, and tons of people have great results on it. My acne is gone 100% from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.\",\n",

It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!\",\n",

Very difficult to lay down, must do it very slowly or spasms occur. Must take stool softeners to avoid a regular bowel movement or else trauma to rectum can occur with bleeding (usually mild) and possible hemroids. Sun light sensitivity. Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines. Monthly blood test due to toxicity of medication on liver and kidneys. must be on birth control at all times. Long term problems are still persisting...Good luck people... so the risks are crazy but this stuff works if you truly have severe all else fails cystic acne..BUT results may not last...I had to go through this again at 23! Also this stuff will put you in the poor house if not insured! Meds 7 blood work is a big expense! Hope this helps...',\n",

I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient.

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end! Accutane can really boost your self confidence. I would recommend on giving it a try. It could change your life forever!\",\n",

By the end of the fifth month i was clear, and remained clear for a year. However the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne, but it only affects the areas around my nose, unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. If you notice any spots return, contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am, otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made.\",\n",

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.\",\n",

This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain...',\n",

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks.

Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines.

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about.

When sexual side effects began in month 2, my dermatologist suggested using a personal lubricant during sex (which was never needed before treatment began) and that the problem would clear up once I was finished with the treatment. I began the treatment in Febuary 2007 and finished September 2007.  The problem with dry skin cleared up rapidly, but I continue to struggle with the sexual side effects (as of June 2008).  I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably, but it causes constant vaginal discharge. I am now able to have sex about once ever 2-4 weeks, but have yet to experience a vaginal orgasm.',\n",

I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently.

I had to go to the hospital, because the dermatologist I used at the time, did not have lab testing equipment, that could be done at his office. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only other thing I used and that was advised to me was to use a mild moisturizer, and the was Oil of Olay, they now call it Olay, and to use Dove soap.  I drank like a gallon of water a day, because I got cotton mouth, but that came and went, and was never constant. (I was never told to use sunscreen!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter, about the end of the 2nd month of using Accutane, my face was just about free of any acne.  By the third month, my acne was just about gone.  The rest of the following months, I was free of acne.  The following months my face stayed dry all the time, and I just used Olay, in the morning and in the evening. By the end of the 8 months, I was taken off Accutane, and have never had acne since.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the best thing that has ever happened to my skin.

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

I took 80mg/day for 5 months and weigh 200 lbs (90 kgs) so it was about 1 mg/day/kg, which is a moderate to high dose I was told. My lips were pretty dry and cracked if I didn't put on chapstick all the time. I also had really dry skin if I didn't put lotion on my shoulders, arms, back, and face after showering. Everything else was 100% fine though. No nosebleeds, no depression, no hair loss, no unbearable side effects. These horror stories are overblown and rare, and tons of people have great results on it. My acne is gone 100% from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.\",\n",

I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle.

It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!\",\n",

Very difficult to lay down, must do it very slowly or spasms occur. Must take stool softeners to avoid a regular bowel movement or else trauma to rectum can occur with bleeding (usually mild) and possible hemroids. Sun light sensitivity. Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines. Monthly blood test due to toxicity of medication on liver and kidneys. must be on birth control at all times. Long term problems are still persisting...Good luck people... so the risks are crazy but this stuff works if you truly have severe all else fails cystic acne..BUT results may not last...I had to go through this again at 23! Also this stuff will put you in the poor house if not insured! Meds 7 blood work is a big expense! Hope this helps...',\n",

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently.

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.\",\n",
       "  'Some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain...',\n",
       "  \"FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks.

Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines. Monthly blood test due to toxicity of medication on liver and kidneys. must be on birth control at all times. Long term problems are still persisting...Good luck people... so the risks are crazy but this stuff works if you truly have severe all else fails cystic acne..BUT results may not last...I had to go through this again at 23!

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably, but it causes constant vaginal discharge. I am now able to have sex about once ever 2-4 weeks, but have yet to experience a vaginal orgasm.',\n",

I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end! Accutane can really boost your self confidence. I would recommend on giving it a try. It could change your life forever!\",\n",

Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently.

I had no insurance, so at the time I was using Accutane, it was $90.00, for a 30 day supply.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI had to go once a month for a blood test, to make sure all organs were working properly. I had to go to the hospital, because the dermatologist I used at the time, did not have lab testing equipment, that could be done at his office. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only other thing I used and that was advised to me was to use a mild moisturizer, and the was Oil of Olay, they now call it Olay, and to use Dove soap.  I drank like a gallon of water a day, because I got cotton mouth, but that came and went, and was never constant. (I was never told to use sunscreen!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter, about the end of the 2nd month of using Accutane, my face was just about free of any acne.  By the third month, my acne was just about gone.  The rest of the following months, I was free of acne.  The following months my face stayed dry all the time, and I just used Olay, in the morning and in the evening. By the end of the 8 months, I was taken off Accutane, and have never had acne since.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the best thing that has ever happened to my skin.  I fought acne from the age of 14 to the age of around 24.  12 years later, I am still acne free.',\n",

THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.\",\n",

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.\",\n",

       "  \"I was 15/16 years when I was on accutane. It's hard enough being in high school but having acne on top. I tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!\",\n",

However they will come back (for me anyways) after 4 yrs with stress, mentral cycle, I get them on my jaw line even if i just hold a alcohol swabbed cell phone...Its from mechanical pressure. They last forever and scar me! So the benefits were great but so are the side effects...',\n",
       "  'DRY everything! LIPS & EYEs! intolerance to contacts! Hair LOSS! Spinal cord spasming and tightening from loss of joint fluid!!! Very difficult to lay down, must do it very slowly or spasms occur. Must take stool softeners to avoid a regular bowel movement or else trauma to rectum can occur with bleeding (usually mild) and possible hemroids. Sun light sensitivity. Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines. Monthly blood test due to toxicity of medication on liver and kidneys. must be on birth control at all times. Long term problems are still persisting...Good luck people... so the risks are crazy but this stuff works if you truly have severe all else fails cystic acne..BUT results may not last...I had to go through this again at 23! Also this stuff will put you in the poor house if not insured! Meds 7 blood work is a big expense! Hope this helps...',\n",

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about.

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently.

I noticed no difference in the first few months and became very frustrated at this. It was only towards the end of the fourth month that it started to become noticablly clearer with only a few spots. By the end of the fifth month i was clear, and remained clear for a year. However the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne, but it only affects the areas around my nose, unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. If you notice any spots return, contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am, otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made.\",\n",

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

       "  'Some of my side effects were really dry lips, sensitive eyes,burning sensation on my face, sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin, dry eyes, stomach pain, slight depression, achy body, back pain, joint pain...',\n",
       "  \"FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!\",\n",

Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines. Monthly blood test due to toxicity of medication on liver and kidneys. must be on birth control at all times. Long term problems are still persisting...Good luck people... so the risks are crazy but this stuff works if you truly have severe all else fails cystic acne..BUT results may not last...I had to go through this again at 23!

The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably, but it causes constant vaginal discharge. I am now able to have sex about once ever 2-4 weeks, but have yet to experience a vaginal orgasm.',\n",

I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications, but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes, the side effects were odious, but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips, in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes, and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day, and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily, red eyes, nosebleeds, and minor depression. In addition, IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair, which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual, but I wanted to spread the word that it can work, and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end! Accutane can really boost your self confidence. I would recommend on giving it a try. It could change your life forever!\",\n",

Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently.

I had no insurance, so at the time I was using Accutane, it was $90.00, for a 30 day supply.  \\r\\n\\r\\nI had to go once a month for a blood test, to make sure all organs were working properly. I had to go to the hospital, because the dermatologist I used at the time, did not have lab testing equipment, that could be done at his office. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe only other thing I used and that was advised to me was to use a mild moisturizer, and the was Oil of Olay, they now call it Olay, and to use Dove soap.  I drank like a gallon of water a day, because I got cotton mouth, but that came and went, and was never constant. (I was never told to use sunscreen!)\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter, about the end of the 2nd month of using Accutane, my face was just about free of any acne.  By the third month, my acne was just about gone.  The rest of the following months, I was free of acne.  The following months my face stayed dry all the time, and I just used Olay, in the morning and in the evening. By the end of the 8 months, I was taken off Accutane, and have never had acne since.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIt was the best thing that has ever happened to my skin.  I fought acne from the age of 14 to the age of around 24.  12 years later, I am still acne free.',\n",

THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne, it shrunk my pores, made my skin less oily, and my hair, smoother skin, brighter skin, even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.\",\n",

Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane, it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment, your acne usually comes all out, but after that, you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion, if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.\",\n",

On completion, my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne, give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it, but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.\",\n",

       "  \"I was 15/16 years when I was on accutane. It's hard enough being in high school but having acne on top. I tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!\",\n",

Very difficult to lay down, must do it very slowly or spasms occur. Must take stool softeners to avoid a regular bowel movement or else trauma to rectum can occur with bleeding (usually mild) and possible hemroids. Sun light sensitivity. Major migraines due to increase pressure from synthetic vit A on the brain. Its much worse if you are prone to migraines. Monthly blood test due to toxicity of medication on liver and kidneys. must be on birth control at all times. Long term problems are still persisting...Good luck people... so the risks are crazy but this stuff works if you truly have severe all else fails cystic acne..BUT results may not last...I had to go through this again at 23! Also this stuff will put you in the poor house if not insured! Meds 7 blood work is a big expense! Hope this helps...',\n",
